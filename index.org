* Welcome to my website!

* About me:
I'm Jonathan Aguilar, a staff scientist at Space Telescope Science Institute supporting MIRI coronagraphy for JWST. I did my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins working with Dr. Laurent Pueyo on direct imaging of substellar objects, and I was also advised by Prof. Kevin Schlaufman. Afterwards, I spent a year as a post-doc working with Dr. Elena Sabbi at STScI.

~About me~

I'm Jonathan Aguilar, a staff scientist at [[https://www.stsci.edu][Space Telescope Science Institute]] supporting MIRI coronagraphy for JWST. I spent a year as a post-doc working with [[https://www.stsci.edu/~sabbi/][Dr. Elena Sabbi]] at STScI studying star and planet formation in young open clusters. Before that, I was a National Physical Science Consortium fellow (now called [[https://stemfellowships.org/][Graduate Fellowships for STEM Diversity]]) at Johns Hopkins, where I did my Ph.D. with [[https://www.stsci.edu/~pueyo/][Dr. Laurent Pueyo]] (co-advised by [[https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/directory/kevin-schlaufman/][Prof. Kevin Schlaufman]] on direct imaging of substellar objects.
